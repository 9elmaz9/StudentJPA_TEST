Java Persistence Query Language (JPQL).
JPQL stands for Java Persistence Query Language defined in JPA specification.  
The Java Persistence Query Language JPQL is an object-oriented query language that is used to perform database operations on persistent entities. Instead of the database table, JPQL uses the entity object model to operate the SQL queries. 
Java Persistence Query Language  JPQL is developed based on SQL syntax.
JPQL wonâ€™t affect the database directly.

Java Persistence Query Language JPQL is an extension of Entity JavaBeans Query Language (EJBQL), adding the following important features to 
- perform join operations.
- update and delete data in a bulk.
- perform an aggregate function (sorting or grouping)
- have singe and multiple value result types

In this video, we are going to learn how to use Java Persistence Query Language JPQL to :
- find an entity
- update an entity
- sort an entity
- filter an entity
- delete an entity 
- how to use the NamedQuery annotation.

Java Persistence Query Language JPQL syntax is very similar to the syntax of SQL.
